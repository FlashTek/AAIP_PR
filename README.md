# Advanced Algorithms in Physics - Pattern Recognition I

Source code of the project "Pattern Recognition I" for the lecture "Advanced Algorithms in Physics"

The source code used for task 1 (morphological image operations) can be found in the folder named "task1".

The source code used for task 2 (neural network) can be found in the folder named "task2".

Each folder contains a subfolder called "results" in which the most important plots are saved as a *.pdf file.

The source code has been tested on Python 3.6.3. Additionally to the default packages of python, this project also needs numpy, scipy, matplotlib and PIL to be working.
